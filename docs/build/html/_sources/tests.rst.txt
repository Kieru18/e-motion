Tests specification
===================

Standards for Handling Errors and Exceptional Situations
--------------------------------------------------------

1. HTTP Status Codes: The tests check the expected HTTP status codes for different scenarios, such as HTTP_200_OK, HTTP_201_CREATED, HTTP_202_ACCEPTED, HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, and HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND. This follows the standard conventions for RESTful APIs.

2. Assertions: The unittest library is used for assertions, ensuring that the expected conditions are met during the tests.

3. Error Messages: Some tests check for specific error messages or details in the response content, providing useful information for debugging.

Types of Tests
--------------

1. Unit Tests: The tests cover individual components, such as the signup, login, logout, and project-related functionalities. Each test case focuses on a specific aspect of the application.

2. Integration Tests: Some tests involve multiple components interacting with each other, such as authentication and authorization checks during login and logout.

3. Functional Tests: The tests simulate the behavior of the application by interacting with its API endpoints, checking responses, and ensuring the correct execution of various functionalities.

Specification and Description of Test Types
-------------------------------------------

SignUpViewTests: Tests the signup functionality with various scenarios, including valid data, invalid existing username, invalid existing email, no email, bad email, no username, no password, and no username and password.

LoginViewTests: Tests the login functionality with valid and invalid scenarios, including wrong password, non-existent username, no username, no password, and no username and password.

LogoutViewTests: Tests the logout functionality for authenticated and unauthenticated users, including cases with and without a token.

TestTokenViewTests: Tests the token test functionality for an authenticated user.

ListProjectsViewTests: Tests the listing of projects, including valid and empty scenarios.

ListModelsViewTest: Tests the listing of models for a specific project, including valid and empty scenarios.

ProjectCreateViewTests: Tests the creation of a project with valid and invalid scenarios, including unauthorized and missing data.

ModelCreateViewTests: Tests the creation of a model with valid and invalid scenarios, including empty project, bad architecture, no data, and unauthorized access.

UploadAnnotationViewTests: Tests the upload of annotations with valid and invalid scenarios, including unauthenticated access, invalid file types, and missing files.

ProjectDeleteViewTests: Tests the deletion of a project with valid and invalid scenarios, including non-existent projects.

ProjectEditViewTests: Tests the editing of a project with valid and invalid scenarios, including missing ID and incorrect fields.

ListScoresViewTest: Tests the listing of scores for a model.

MakePredictionsViewTest: Tests making predictions for a model with various scenarios.

TrainViewTests: Tests the training endpoint with unauthenticated access.

Test Scenarios
--------------

Each test case explores different scenarios, covering a wide range of inputs and conditions to ensure robustness and reliability of the application.

Test Quality Measures
---------------------

Readability: The tests are well-organized, with clear setup, test execution, and assertion phases. Descriptive method and variable names enhance readability.

Coverage: The tests cover various aspects of user authentication, project, and model management, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

Consistency: The naming conventions and structure of the tests are consistent, promoting maintainability.

Documentation: Inline comments provide additional context for specific test scenarios.
