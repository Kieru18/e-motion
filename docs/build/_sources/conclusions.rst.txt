Conclusions and future deployment
=================================

Conclusions
-----------

1. It is very important to carefully check the possibilities of integration with another open-source application at the early design stage to avoid problems that cannot be solved at the implementation stage.
2. The system architecture design phase is crucial for an efficient implementation phase.
3. When creating complex systems, it is crucial to design the system appropriately and in detail; you also need to remember to check whether the method of implementing the function is possible given the adopted assumptions.
4. It is important to properly estimate the working time on the project; if there is too little time, it is possible that not all functions will be implemented, or integration with external services may prove too expensive.

Future deployment
-----------------

In the future we would like to offer it as a Python package, available through the Python Package Index (PyPI).
This strategic move will empower users to seamlessly install E-motion using the popular package manager pip,
streamlining the integration process and facilitating quicker adoption. By providing E-motion as a pip package,
we aim to enhance the overall user experience and cater to a broader audience of Python developers.
